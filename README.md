# StackPay — Decentralized Payroll & Salary Streaming on Stacks

StackPay is a decentralized payroll and salary streaming appliation built on the Stacks blockchain.  
It enables companies, DAOs, and founders to stream salaris to contributors in real time using block-based accrual, with full supprt fo WalletConec-enabled Stacks wallets.

Employees can withdraw earned wages at any time, while employers manage payroll in a transparent and non-custodial wy

- Multi-wallet compatibility
- Secure, non-custodial authentication
- Standardized wallet connection flw
Wallet connections are implemented uing the Stacks Connect SDK with built-in WalletConnect support.

## How Salary Streaming Works

Stacks does not support continuous time, so StackPay uses block height as a deterministic time source

Salary accrual is calculated as:

(current block − last withdrawal block) × rate per block

Employees can withdraw their accumulated salary at any point while the stream remains active.

## WalletConnect Integration Details

Wallet connections are handled through the Stacks Connect SDK, which supports WalletConnect-compatible Stacks wallets.

Connection flow:
1. User initiates wallet connection from the interface
2. WalletConnect modal opens
3. User selects a supported wallet
4. Session metadata is established
5. All contract calls require explicit wallet approval

This setup exposes wallet session metadata and emits WalletConnect events that can be externally observed.

## Smart Contract Overview

The payroll logic is implemented in a Clarity smart contract.

Core functions include:
- create-stream: initialize a new salary stream
- withdraw: withdraw earned salary
- fund-stream: add funds to an existing stream
- cancel-stream: terminate a salary stream

Each stream tracks:
- Employer address
- Employee address
- Rate per block
- Last withdrawal block
- Remaining balance
- Stream status

All state changes are recorded on-chain and can be indexed externally.

## Deployment

- Frontend can be deployed on Vercel or Netlify
- Smart contracts are deployed using Clarinet or the Stacks CLI
- WalletConnect works automatically in development and production environments

---

## Observability and Indexing

StackPay is designed to be easily observable through:
- Wallet connection metadata
- WalletConnect session events
- On-chain contract calls
- Stream creation and withdrawal transactions

This enables reliable detection of wallet integrations and payroll activity.

---

## Security

- No private keys are stored
- Funds are held entirely in smart contracts
- Explicit wallet approvals are required for all actions
- Deterministic Clarity execution ensures predictable behavior
